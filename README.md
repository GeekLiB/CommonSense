ConceptNet aims to give computers access to common-sense knowledge, the kind of
information that ordinary people know but usually leave unstated.

This Python package contains a toolset for loading new datasets into ConceptNet
5, and it serves the HTML and JSON Web APIs for it. You don't need it to simply
access ConceptNet 5; see http://conceptnet5.media.mit.edu for more information.

If you're interested in using ConceptNet, please join the conceptnet-users Google
group: http://groups.google.com/group/conceptnet-users?hl=en
