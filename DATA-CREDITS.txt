## Licenses for included resources

### Commonsense Computing

The Commonsense Computing project originated at the MIT Media Lab and expanded
worldwide. Tens of thousands of contributors have taken some time to teach
facts to computers. Their pseudonyms can be found in the "sources" list found
in ConceptNet's raw data and in its API.


### Games with a Purpose

Data collected from Verbosity, one of the CMU "Games with a Purpose", is used
and released under ConceptNet's license, by permission from Luis von Ahn and
Harshit Surana.

Verbosity players are anonymous, so in the "sources" list, data from Verbosity
is simply credited to the pseudonym "verbosity".


### UMBEL

UMBEL is available under a Creative Commons Attribution license. Here are
UMBEL's license terms, adapted from [Umbel]:

UMBEL and its documentation are the joint creative works of Structured Dynamics
LLC [SD] and Ontotext AD [Ontotext], which grant free use rights thereto, only
limited by the attribution terms described in the Creative Commons 3.0
Attribution License [CC-By-3]. The copyrights to UMBEL and its documentation
remain the sole rights of Structured Dynamics LLC and Ontotext AD.

The UMBEL Reference Concept Ontology is based on a faithful but reduced subset
extraction of concepts and relationships from the OpenCyc version of the Cyc
knowledge base. As such, UMBEL is a lightweight reflection of these sources,
but not nearly as capable nor complete.

Use and relations based on UMBEL may therefore not be an accurate
representation of what might be obtained in working directly with the source
Cyc or OpenCyc knowledge bases.

### Wikimedia projects

ConceptNet uses data directly from Wiktionary, the free dictionary [wiktionary].
It also uses data from Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia [wikipedia] via DBPedia
[dbpedia].

Wiktionary and Wikipedia are collaborative projects, authored by their
respective online communities. They are currently released under the Creative
Commons Attribution-ShareAlike license [CC-By-SA-3].

Wikimedia encourages giving attribution by providing links to the hosted pages
that the data came from, and DBPedia asks for the same thing in turn. In the
raw data and the Web API, the sources of Wikimedia contributions can be found
as URLs following the token `/s/web`.

For example, an assertion attributed to `/s/web/de.wiktionary.org/wiki/Sprache/`
uses information extracted from the page that can be seen on the Web at
http://de.wiktionary.org/wiki/Sprache. Its list of individual contributors can
be seen at: http://de.wiktionary.org/wiki/Sprache?action=history

Information from DBPedia is credited in a way that is designed to encourage
interoperability with DBPedia. ConceptNet nodes that use information from
DBPedia are linked to their DBPedia nodes in RDF N-Triples format. These links
can be found in the `data/sw_map` directory.
