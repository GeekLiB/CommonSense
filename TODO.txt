Design of ConceptNet 5.5:

- [x] Download Numberbatch vectors alongside DB
- [x] Fix dependencies for conceptnet5.vectors: sklearn? pandas?
- [x] Querying an assertion gives an 'edges' list that links to itself -- remove the nested level?
- [x] Wiktionary links should be ExternalURLs, not sources
- [ ] Fix tests

For ConceptNet 5.5.1:

- [ ] Use standardized language codes in Wiktionary forms
- [ ] Remove "archa√Øque" context
- [ ] Higher weights on monolingual things, lower weights on uncommon languages

Web interface:

- [x] Link to an FAQ
- [x] Link to the JSON-LD version of the current page
- [ ] Add a page listing languages
- [ ] Add a page per language
- [x] API root should link to docs
- [x] Serve some Noto web fonts (not CJK ones though)
- [x] Handle MemoryErrors

ConceptNet 5.6 perhaps:

- [ ] Nodes should have labels that are stored separately from their edges
- [ ] Relabel vague nodes like "someone" and "something"
- [ ] Infer things from verb phrases
